## Here's some stuff that I've made.


### Fire Simulation wip
![Fire simulation preview](https://msivonen.github.io/firesim_preview.jpg)

This simulation is based on circle-circle 2d elastic collision simulation. I've added a temperature property to the particles. Hotter particles have less weight than colder ones (mass doesn't change by weight). Hot enough and the weight is negative. At the bottom there's a heater that heats nearby particles. Particles also conduct heat to each other and their heat decays over time.

Play around with the sliders and it's guaranteed to go fubar. See the 'wip' in the title...

I got this idea from a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKEFlg_JMmU) that I saw some time ago, and I decided to make my own version. No code is borrowed or stolen.
