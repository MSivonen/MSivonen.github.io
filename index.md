## Here's some stuff that I've made.

### Fire Simulation

This simulation is based on circle-circle 2d elastic collision simulation. I've added a temperature property to the particles. Hotter particles have less weight (not mass) than colder ones. Hot enough and the weight is negative. At the bottom there's a heater that heats nearby particles. Particles also conduct heat to each other and their heat decays over time.

Play around with the settings and it's guaranteed to go fubar.

Check the blue background, to see how everything works.

I got this idea from a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKEFlg_JMmU) that I saw some time ago, and I decided to make ~~a shameless copy~~ my own version of it...

### Quad tree

Check interactions between points, only if they are inside a specified range.
This is a simple example; check if the circles overlap inside the big circle/rectangle.
Yes, I know my circles have sharp edges. That's to improve performance.

### Metaballs

I thought of adding this to my fire sim, but didn't. It's pretty, so go take a look.

### Raycasting

Simple raycasting demo. wsad to move.
